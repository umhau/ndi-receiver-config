<body>

Press the button to turn on the computers that receive the NDI stream.  When you confirm the computers are on (about 90 seconds), then press the button to start the stream. Both buttons will control all the NDI receivers.

<br> <br>

<form action="multiple_submit_buttons.php" method="post">
<input name="btn_submit" value="Power on NDI receivers" type="submit" />
<br> <br>
<input name="btn_submit" value="Start NDI stream" type="submit" />

<br> <br>
CAUTION - these buttons will interrupt the NDI stream!
<br> <br>

<input name="btn_submit" value="Stop NDI stream" type="submit" />
<br> <br>
<input name="btn_submit" value="Power off NDI receivers" type="submit" /> 
</form>

Use the 'stop stream' function to restart the stream in case of a problem.  When the service is concluded, just shut down the computers. No need to stop the stream first.
